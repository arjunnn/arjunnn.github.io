## My website

Source code for my website, built with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), and is live here - https://arjun.ninja/

It is served through GitHub Pages, via the `master` branch, which contains all the built files.
The `gatsby` branch contains all the development code.

### Set up locally:

- Have [gatsby-cli](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/) installed
- `yarn` in the folder where you cloned this repo
- `yarn dev`
- Open server at http://localhost:8000
